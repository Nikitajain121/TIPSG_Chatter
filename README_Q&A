# ü§ñ Interview Q&A: Streamlit + LlamaIndex Chatbot Project

## 1. What is the purpose of using `llama_index` in your chatbot project?
**Answer:**  
`llama_index` (formerly GPT Index) allows efficient retrieval of information from documents by creating vector indexes. In this project, it is used to turn directory-based documents into a searchable index that the chatbot can query in a conversational manner.

---

## 2. Explain the role of `VectorStoreIndex` in the chatbot.
**Answer:**  
`VectorStoreIndex` stores vector embeddings of documents. It enables semantic search and retrieval of the most relevant document chunks based on user queries, supporting intelligent response generation.

---

## 3. How does `SimpleDirectoryReader` work?
**Answer:**  
`SimpleDirectoryReader` reads all text-based documents from a specified directory, parses them into `Document` objects, and returns them for further indexing.

---

## 4. What does `chat_mode="condense_question"` mean?
**Answer:**  
This mode reformulates follow-up questions into standalone ones. It helps the chatbot maintain context in multi-turn conversations by condensing the user‚Äôs query using chat history.

---

## 5. Why do we use `dotenv` in this project?
**Answer:**  
The `.env` file stores sensitive environment variables like the OpenAI API key. `dotenv` is used to load these variables securely into the application at runtime without hardcoding secrets.

---

## 6. How is the OpenAI API key accessed securely?
**Answer:**  
The key is stored in a `.env` file and accessed via `os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")`, ensuring the actual key is not exposed in the source code.

---

## 7. What does `index.as_chat_engine()` do?
**Answer:**  
This converts the vector index into a chat engine that can handle queries conversationally. It supports chat history and advanced prompting modes for interactive Q&A.

---

## 8. What does `chat_engine.chat(prompt)` return?
**Answer:**  
It sends the prompt to the LLM-powered engine and returns a response based on the most relevant indexed documents and conversational context.

---

## 9. What is the purpose of `MAX_QUESTIONS`?
**Answer:**  
This constant limits the number of user queries per session to prevent overload or abuse and to encourage structured interactions.

---

## 10. What is the use of `PromptTemplate` in LlamaIndex?
**Answer:**  
`PromptTemplate` allows you to customize the format of prompts sent to the language model, giving you better control over the behavior and tone of the chatbot.

---

## 11. Why is summarization used for long responses?
**Answer:**  
To ensure clarity and avoid overwhelming the user with long answers, the response is summarized using LSA or TextRank if it exceeds a specific word limit.

---

## 12. What is the difference between `LsaSummarizer` and `TextRankSummarizer`?
**Answer:**  
- `LsaSummarizer`: Uses Latent Semantic Analysis to extract important sentences based on concept frequency.
- `TextRankSummarizer`: Graph-based ranking algorithm that identifies important sentences through sentence similarity.

---

## 13. How is session state managed in Streamlit?
**Answer:**  
`st.session_state` is used to persist user messages, number of questions, and other session variables across reruns, enabling continuous interaction.

---

## 14. What is the function of `st.form()` in your chatbot?
**Answer:**  
`st.form()` is used to collect user details like name, contact, and email in a structured and grouped format, submitting all fields together.

---

## 15. How is the chat history displayed?
**Answer:**  
HTML and CSS are used inside `st.markdown()` to render styled chat bubbles with avatars and timestamps in a readable format.

---

## 16. How is the chatbot responsive on mobile?
**Answer:**  
Custom CSS using media queries adapts padding, font size, and input field widths to ensure a good user experience on smaller screens.

---

## 17. How does `store_user_info()` work?
**Answer:**  
It's a custom function likely defined in the `connector` module, used to store or log user input (name, contact, email) for feedback or analytics.

---

## 18. What does `load_data()` from `dataloader` likely do?
**Answer:**  
It initializes and returns the `VectorStoreIndex` by loading and indexing document data from the file system.

---

## 19. Why is `sys.modules['sqlite3'] = sys.modules.pop('pysqlite3')` used?
**Answer:**  
This monkey-patches the Python interpreter to use `pysqlite3` instead of the default `sqlite3`. It‚Äôs useful when compatibility issues or advanced SQLite features are required.

---

## 20. What happens when the user clicks ‚ÄúClear Chat‚Äù?
**Answer:**  
The `st.session_state` is cleared using `st.session_state.clear()` and the app is rerun with `st.experimental_rerun()`, effectively resetting the chatbot.

---

## 21. How does the chatbot limit user queries?
**Answer:**  
It tracks the number of user queries in `st.session_state.num_questions` and compares it to `MAX_QUESTIONS`. When exceeded, a warning message is shown.

---

## 22. What are some alternatives to `LlamaIndex` and `Streamlit`?
**Answer:**  
Alternatives include:
- **For LlamaIndex**: LangChain, Haystack, RAGStack
- **For Streamlit**: Gradio, Flask + HTML, Dash

---

## 23. How can this chatbot be scaled for production?
**Answer:**  
By deploying it with:
- Backend APIs using FastAPI/Flask
- Caching responses
- Cloud storage for documents
- Persistent vector stores like Pinecone or ChromaDB
- CI/CD pipelines and containerization (e.g., Docker)

---
## How did you implement storing user information in the PostgreSQL database?

**Answer:**  
I used the `psycopg2` Python library to connect and interact with a PostgreSQL database. The process involved:

- Establishing a connection to the PostgreSQL server using credentials like host, user, password, database name, and port.
- Creating a cursor object to execute SQL commands.
- Writing an `INSERT` SQL statement with placeholders for user data (`user_name`, `contact`, `mail_id`).
- Executing the query with the provided values safely to avoid SQL injection.
- Committing the transaction to save changes.
- Handling exceptions such as connection errors.
- Closing the cursor and connection in a `finally` block to ensure proper resource cleanup.

Example code snippet:

```python
import psycopg2

def store_user_info(user_name, contact, mail_id):
    try:
        connection = psycopg2.connect(
            host="98.70.11.123",
            user="postgres",
            password="postgre",
            database="postgres",
            port=3002
        )
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        sql = "INSERT INTO any_table (user_name, contact, mail_id) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
        val = (user_name, contact, mail_id)
        cursor.execute(sql, val)
        connection.commit()
        print(cursor.rowcount, "record inserted")
    except psycopg2.OperationalError as err:
        print("Error connecting to PostgreSQL database:", err)
    finally:
        if connection:
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()
